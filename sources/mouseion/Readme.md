Origin of Library Name
----------------------

The **Musaeum** or **Mouseion** at Alexandria which included the famous Library
of Alexandria,[1] was an institution said to have been founded by Ptolemy I
Soter.  This original Musaeum ("Institution of the Muses") was the home of
music or poetry, a philosophical school and library such as Plato's Academy,
and also a storehouse of texts. It did not have a collection of works of art;
rather it was an institution that brought together some of the best scholars of
the Hellenistic world, analogous to a modern university. This original Musaeum
was the source for the modern usage of the word museum. 

This library is a collection of utilities that I have developed over the years
to facilitate HPC scientific programming.
