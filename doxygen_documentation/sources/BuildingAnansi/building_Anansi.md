# Building Anansi {#BuildingAnansi}

## Overview of building Anansi

We first provide an overview of building Anansi. 

Building Anansi can be broadly separated into 3 stages. The first stage is to
satisfy the library prerequisites.  The second stage is to set the build
runtime environment which consists of setting critical environmental variables.
The last stage to run the Anansi build command.

The mandatory library prerequisites 

    Software | Version Requirements
    -------- | --------------------
    CMake    |  >= 3.26.4
    MPI      |  supports mpi 1, 2 and 3 standard 
    C++,     |  supports c++20 
    Python   | >= 3.7
    Boost    | >= 1.82.0

are needed to build Anansi. The optional prerequisite

    Software | Version Requirements
    -------- | --------------------
    Doxygen  | >= 1.10.0

is only needed for building documentation.
